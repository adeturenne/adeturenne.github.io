I am an **Associate Professor** in Signal and Image Processing at Université de Toulouse and IRIT (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse).

My research interests focus on **medical image processing** (4D Flow MRI, MRI, CT, etc). I develop methods based on inverse problems and deep learning, driven by clinical needs, for tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, and segmentation. More recently, I have been exploring the potential of **quantum computing** for signal and image processing, including both quantum algorithmic approaches and quantum machine learning methods.

I received my **PhD** in 2023 from Université de Rennes, conducted at the LTSI laboratory. My doctoral research focused on image-based support for endovascular navigation, with contributions in 3D vascular segmentation from MRA, 3D/2D multimodal registration, and patient similarity modeling for mechanical thrombectomy. From 2023 to 2024, I worked as a **postdoctoral researcher** at Université de Rennes / LTSI, where I investigated registration methods for 4D Flow MRI. Since 2024, I have been an **Associate Professor** at Université de Toulouse and IRIT.
