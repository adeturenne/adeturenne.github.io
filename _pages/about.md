I am an **Associate Professor** in Signal and Image Processing at **Université de Toulouse** and **IRIT** (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse).
*=
My research interests focus on **medical image processing**, particularly MRI, CT, and 4D Flow MRI. I develop methods based on **inverse problems** and **deep learning** for tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, and segmentation.
More recently, I have been developing a growing interest in **quantum computing** for signal and image processing, exploring both algorithmic quantum approaches and quantum machine learning methods. 

I received my **PhD** in 2023 from Université de Rennes , conducted at the LTSI laboratory, where my doctoral research focused on MRI segmentation and multimodal image registration (MRI and fluoroscopy) to support endovascular navigation in the context of mechanical thrombectomy. From 2023 to 2024, I worked as a **postdoctoral researcher** at Université de Rennes / LTSI, where I investigated registration methods for 4D Flow MRI. Since 2024, I have been an **Associate Professor** at Université de Toulouse and IRIT.
